Manure is organic material derived from animal feces, often mixed with bedding material like straw or sawdust. It is a rich source of nutrients essential for plant growth, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In ecological and agricultural systems, manure is used as a natural fertilizer to improve soil fertility and structure. It enhances microbial activity, aids in moisture retention, and contributes to the overall health of the soil ecosystem. Manure also supports sustainable farming practices by recycling nutrients back into the soil, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, and promoting a closed-loop system.
