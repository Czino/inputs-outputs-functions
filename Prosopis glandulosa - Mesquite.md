Mesquite is a shrub or small tree with pinnate leaves and long, bean-like pods. It is valued for its hardy wood, used in furniture and as firewood. The pods are edible and were traditionally used by Native American tribes as a food source. Mesquite also improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.
