Shade is the area where direct sunlight is obstructed, typically by trees, buildings, or other structures. In gardening, providing shade helps protect sensitive plants from excessive heat and sunlight, reducing the risk of sunburn and dehydration. Shade also creates a cooler microclimate, benefiting both plants and people in hot climates.
