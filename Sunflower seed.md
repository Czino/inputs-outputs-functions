Sunflower seeds are harvested from the large flower heads of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus). These seeds are encased in black and white striped shells and are rich in healthy fats, protein, fiber, and vitamins, particularly vitamin E. Sunflower seeds are consumed as a snack, added to salads, baked goods, and used to produce sunflower oil. They promote heart health, support the immune system, and provide essential nutrients.
