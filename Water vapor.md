Water vapor is the gaseous form of water present in the atmosphere. It is a key component of the Earth's water cycle and plays a crucial role in regulating climate and weather patterns. Plants release water vapor into the air through transpiration, which helps cool the environment and contributes to cloud formation and precipitation.
