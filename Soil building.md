Soil building is the process of enhancing soil quality and fertility through the addition of organic matter, such as compost, mulch, and cover crops. This practice improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and supports a healthy microbial ecosystem, leading to more productive and sustainable plant growth.
