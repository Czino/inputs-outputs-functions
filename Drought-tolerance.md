Drought-tolerance refers to a plant's ability to survive and thrive in conditions with limited water availability. Drought-tolerant plants have adaptations such as deep root systems, reduced leaf size, waxy leaf coatings, or the ability to store water in their tissues. These plants are ideal for xeriscaping, a landscaping method that reduces or eliminates the need for irrigation. Drought-tolerant plants help conserve water, reduce maintenance costs, and are essential in regions prone to drought.
