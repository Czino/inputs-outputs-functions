In an ecological system, clouds play a pivotal role in the water cycle, influencing climate and weather patterns. They are formed from water vapor that condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals in the atmosphere. Clouds are essential for distributing water across the planet through precipitation, which replenishes water sources like rivers, lakes, and soil moisture. This process supports plant growth and maintains ecosystems. Additionally, clouds help regulate the Earth's temperature by reflecting sunlight and trapping heat, thereby influencing both local and global climates.
