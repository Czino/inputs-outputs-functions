A perennial plant is a plant that lives for more than two years, typically flowering and reproducing multiple times during its lifespan. Unlike annuals that complete their life cycle in one growing season and then die, perennials regrow from the same root system each year. They can vary widely in size, shape, and flowering habits, making them popular choices for gardens and landscapes where they provide lasting structure and color.
