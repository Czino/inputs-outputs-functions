Oxygen is a vital element for most life forms on Earth. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight. This oxygen release is crucial for the respiration of animals and humans and helps maintain the balance of gases in the atmosphere.
