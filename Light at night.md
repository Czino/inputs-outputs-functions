Moonlight, a natural source of light at night, provides gentle illumination and influences nocturnal activities in animals. 

It also includes artificial lighting from streetlights, buildings, and vehicles, as well as natural light from celestial bodies such as the moon. While artificial light at night enhances visibility and safety, it can disrupt natural circadian rhythms in wildlife and humans, affecting behavior, sleep patterns, and ecosystems.

Balancing the use of artificial and natural light at night is important for minimizing light pollution and preserving natural nighttime environments.
