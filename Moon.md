The moon significantly influences ecological systems through its gravitational pull, which creates tidal movements in oceans and large bodies of water. These tides impact coastal ecosystems, influencing the behavior and reproductive cycles of marine life. The moon's phases also affect nocturnal animals' behavior, with some species relying on moonlight for navigation and feeding. Additionally, the moon's light impacts plant cycles, particularly those sensitive to lunar rhythms, contributing to the timing of certain biological processes.
