Thermal mass refers to materials that absorb, store, and release heat energy. In gardening and architecture, thermal mass materials like stone, concrete, and water help regulate temperature by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. This property is used to create more stable and comfortable environments in buildings and greenhouses.
