Ecology is the scientific study of how living organisms interact with each other and their environment around them. You can think of any environment as a complex web with many nodes, each node is connected via threads to other nodes which represent the relationship between them. Just like in a spider's web, if one thread is disturbed, it can affect the whole structure. Ecologists study these intricate connections to understand how ecosystems function, maintain balance, and respond to changes.
