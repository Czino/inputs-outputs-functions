Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth, including ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity within species. It encompasses the richness and complexity of biological life and interactions. Plants play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity by providing habitats, food sources, and ecosystem services that sustain a wide range of organisms. Conserving biodiversity is essential for ecosystem stability, resilience, and the provision of ecosystem services that benefit human well-being.
