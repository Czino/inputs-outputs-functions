A "Poop Beast" is a term used to describe certain types of trees, such as poplar and willow, which thrive on humanure (composted human waste). These trees benefit from the rich nutrients found in humanure, growing vigorously and contributing to waste management and nutrient recycling. They play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture and environmental health by transforming waste into valuable biomass.
