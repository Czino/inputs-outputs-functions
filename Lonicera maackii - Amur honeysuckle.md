Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is a deciduous shrub known for its fragrant white flowers and red berries. While attractive, it is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native plants. It provides nectar for pollinators and shelter for birds, but its spread should be controlled.
