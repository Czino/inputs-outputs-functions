Leaves are the primary sites of photosynthesis in plants, where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is vital for the growth and energy supply of plants and forms the foundation of most food webs. In an ecological system, leaves contribute to soil health through their decomposition, adding organic matter and nutrients back into the soil. They also provide habitat and food for a wide range of organisms, including insects and herbivores. Additionally, leaves play a role in regulating the water cycle by facilitating transpiration, which releases water vapor into the atmosphere and helps in maintaining humidity levels and local climate patterns.
