The sun is the primary source of energy for almost all life on Earth. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, forming the base of the food web. This energy supports nearly all terrestrial and aquatic life forms. The sun also drives the Earth's climate and weather patterns, affecting ecosystems globally. Its light and warmth regulate the daily and seasonal rhythms of plants and animals, influencing growth, reproduction, and behavior.
