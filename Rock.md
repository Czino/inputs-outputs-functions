Rocks are solid mineral material found in various sizes and compositions within an ecosystem. They play a crucial role in shaping the landscape, providing habitats and shelter for numerous organisms. Over time, rocks weather into smaller particles, contributing to soil formation and influencing soil pH and mineral content. Rocks also help in regulating water flow by slowing down runoff, reducing erosion, and facilitating groundwater recharge. In addition, rocks can create microhabitats with different temperature and moisture conditions, supporting biodiversity.
