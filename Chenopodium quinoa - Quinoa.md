Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is a pseudocereal known for its small, nutrient-dense seeds that are high in protein, fiber, and essential amino acids. Quinoa is gluten-free and used as a staple in various dishes, including salads, soups, and as a rice substitute. It is also valued for its adaptability to high-altitude and low-rainfall conditions.
