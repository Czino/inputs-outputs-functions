A "Willow Feeder" refers to a specialized outhouse design that safely processes human waste into compost, or humanure, which can then be used to fertilize willow trees. This system ensures that waste is treated and decomposed properly, minimizing health risks and environmental impact. The resulting humanure provides essential nutrients to willows, promoting healthy growth and creating a sustainable cycle of waste utilization and plant nourishment.
