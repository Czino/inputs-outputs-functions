Stars, including our sun, play a role in ecological systems primarily through their contributions to the night sky, which influences the behavior of nocturnal and migratory species. Many animals use the position of stars for navigation during migration. In a broader sense, stars are fundamental to the creation of elements necessary for life, as the heavier elements in our planet and bodies were formed in the cores of stars and distributed through supernova explosions.
