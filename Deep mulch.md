Deep mulch is a gardening technique where a thick layer of organic material, such as straw, leaves, or wood chips, is spread over the soil. This method helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, regulate soil temperature, and improve soil fertility as the mulch decomposes. Deep mulch also protects soil structure and provides a habitat for beneficial microorganisms and insects.
