Cattails, found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes across North America, Europe, and Asia, play a crucial ecological role in water filtration, soil stabilization, and providing habitat. They support biodiversity by offering food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, including birds, insects, and amphibians. Their dense stands help prevent erosion and improve water quality by trapping sediments and absorbing excess nutrients.
