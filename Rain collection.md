Rain collection involves capturing and storing rainwater for later use. This sustainable practice helps conserve water resources, reduces runoff, and provides a free source of water for irrigation, gardening, and household needs. Rain collection systems typically include gutters, downspouts, and storage containers such as rain barrels or cisterns – but soil as means of rain water storage is ideally considered first.
