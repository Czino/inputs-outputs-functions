The ability of organisms and systems to maintain their temperature within a narrow range, regardless of external environmental conditions by absorbing, storing, and slowly releasing heat. Examples include thick walls in buildings, bodies of water, and dense vegetation, which can all help to reduce the impact of external temperature swings, creating a more stable climate for living organisms and human activities.
