Garlic cloves are the individual segments of the garlic bulb, each encased in a papery skin. They are widely used in cooking for their strong flavor and numerous health benefits, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, garlic cloves can be planted to grow new garlic plants or used as a natural repellent to deter pests like insects, rabbits, and deer.
