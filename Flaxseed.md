Flaxseed, also known as linseed, comes from the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). These small, brown or golden seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and lignans, which have antioxidant properties. Flaxseeds are commonly used in baking, smoothies, and as a dietary supplement. They support digestive health, heart health, and can be ground to release their nutritional benefits more effectively.
