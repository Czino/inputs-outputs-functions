A vine is a plant with a growth habit of trailing or climbing stems, lianas, or runners. Vines use various mechanisms such as tendrils, twining stems, or adhesive pads to support themselves as they grow upward or spread across surfaces. They are often used in landscaping to cover trellises, fences, and walls, creating vertical gardens and adding aesthetic appeal to outdoor spaces. Vines can also provide ground cover, prevent soil erosion, and offer habitats for wildlife.
