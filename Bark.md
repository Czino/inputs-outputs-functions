Bark is the outer protective layer of trees and shrubs. It serves as a barrier against physical damage, pests, and diseases. Bark is also used in gardening as mulch, providing benefits such as moisture retention, weed suppression, and soil insulation. Additionally, bark can be processed into various products, including paper, cork, and decorative landscape materials.
