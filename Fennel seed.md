Fennel seeds come from the fennel plant (Foeniculum vulgare), a flowering plant in the carrot family. These small, greenish-brown seeds have a sweet, anise-like flavor and are used as a spice in cooking and baking. Fennel seeds are also known for their medicinal properties, aiding digestion, reducing bloating, and serving as a remedy for coughs and colds. They are commonly used in teas, spice blends, and as a breath freshener.
