Autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) is a deciduous shrub known for its silver-green leaves and small, red berries. The berries are rich in lycopene and can be used in jellies and sauces. However, autumn olive is considered invasive in many areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native plants.
