Pruning is the horticultural practice of selectively removing parts of a plant, such as branches, buds, or roots. It is done to improve the plant's structure, promote healthy growth, enhance fruit or flower production, and remove dead or diseased parts. Pruning helps maintain the desired shape and size of plants and can also prevent the spread of pests and diseases.
