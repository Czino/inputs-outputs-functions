Ground cover refers to plants that are low-growing and spread to cover the ground densely. They are typically used in landscaping to prevent soil erosion, suppress weeds, and add aesthetic appeal. Ground cover plants can be either herbaceous (like creeping thyme or vinca) or woody (like juniper or cotoneaster), and they are chosen based on their ability to thrive in specific conditions such as shade, sun, or moisture levels.
