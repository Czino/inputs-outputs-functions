Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) is a deciduous shrub or small tree with silvery leaves and yellow flowers. It produces small, olive-like fruits that are edible but astringent. The plant is drought-tolerant and used for windbreaks and erosion control, though it is also considered invasive in some regions.
