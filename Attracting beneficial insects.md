Plants that attract insects often produce flowers with vibrant colors, enticing fragrances, or nectar. These plants play a crucial role in ecosystems by supporting pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. Attracting insects is important for the pollination of many crops and flowers, which helps in the production of fruits, seeds, and overall plant diversity.
