A cobalt accumulator is a plant that efficiently absorbs and stores cobalt from the soil. Cobalt is essential in small amounts for certain plant processes and for nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes. These plants help manage cobalt levels in the soil, ensuring that it is available in adequate amounts for nitrogen fixation and other essential biochemical processes, while also aiding in the remediation of cobalt-contaminated soils.
