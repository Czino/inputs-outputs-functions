A silicon accumulator is a plant that efficiently absorbs and stores silicon from the soil. Silicon plays a significant role in enhancing plant strength and resilience by contributing to cell wall structure, improving resistance to pests and diseases, and increasing tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and heavy metal toxicity. These plants help improve soil health and support the growth and durability of other plants.
