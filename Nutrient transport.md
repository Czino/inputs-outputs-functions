Nutrient transport in trees involves the movement of essential minerals and water from the soil to various parts of the tree. This process is facilitated by the tree's vascular system, comprising the xylem and phloem. The xylem transports water and dissolved nutrients from the roots to the leaves, while the phloem distributes the produced food (sugars) from photosynthesis throughout the tree.
