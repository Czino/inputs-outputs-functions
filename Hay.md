Hay is a type of dried grass or legumes that are harvested and stored as animal feed. It is commonly used to feed livestock such as cows, horses, and goats during times when fresh pasture is not available, particularly in winter. Hay is valued for its nutritional content, which provides essential nutrients to animals.
