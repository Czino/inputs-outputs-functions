When designing a system through the permaculture lens the focus shifts from the individual design elements to designing their interconnections which will create healthy and sustainable systems.

Here we are building an intricate web of connections between elements in an ecological design connected by their inputs, outputs and functions.

Inspired by **Gaia's Garden - A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture** by Toby Hemenway.

## How to view

The recommended way to use this repository is to open the folder with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

This way you can open the Graph View. Which allows you to see all connections and also filter down to relevant sections.

To see relevant connections of a specific element open the file and press `CMD+G`(Mac) or `CTRL+G` (Windows, Linux). This will open the Local Graph View.
You can further explore connections by increasing the Depth level.
