Deciduous refers to trees and shrubs that shed their leaves annually, typically in the autumn. This adaptation helps plants conserve water and energy during winter or dry seasons. Deciduous plants are characterized by their seasonal cycle of leaf loss and regrowth, which can enhance the aesthetic appeal of landscapes with seasonal changes in color and form. They are used in gardens and parks for their shade in summer, visual interest in autumn, and the bare architecture of their branches in winter.
