A calcium accumulator is a plant that efficiently absorbs and stores high levels of calcium from the soil. Calcium is essential for plant cell wall structure, signaling, and overall plant growth and development. These plants help improve soil calcium levels, ensuring other plants receive adequate calcium for strong cell walls, root development, and nutrient uptake.
