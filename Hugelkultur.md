Hugelkultur is a sustainable gardening and agricultural practice that involves creating raised garden beds filled with decaying wood, plant material, and soil. This technique mimics natural forest processes and offers several ecological benefits. The decomposing wood within the bed acts like a sponge, retaining moisture and providing a long-term source of nutrients as it breaks down. Hugelkultur beds improve soil structure, promote microbial activity, and support diverse plant growth. This method is particularly effective in areas with poor soil, as it enhances fertility and water retention, creating a more resilient and productive growing environment.
