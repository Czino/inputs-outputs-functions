Soil stabilization involves techniques and processes used to improve the physical properties of soil, making it more stable and suitable for construction, agriculture, and other purposes. Plants play a significant role in soil stabilization by anchoring soil with their roots, reducing erosion, and enhancing soil structure. This is crucial for preventing landslides, maintaining water quality, and supporting sustainable land use practices.
