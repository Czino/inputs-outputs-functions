European cranberry (Viburnum opulus), or guelder rose, is a deciduous shrub with clusters of white flowers and bright red berries. The berries are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications, though they are more tart and less palatable than the American variety. The shrub is also used ornamentally for its showy flowers and colorful fall leaves.
