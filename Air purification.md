Air purification refers to the removal or reduction of pollutants, such as gases, particulates, and odors, from the air. Plants contribute to air purification through processes like photosynthesis and transpiration. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, improving air quality. Additionally, plants' leaves and roots can absorb and break down pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and benzene, effectively filtering the air indoors and outdoors.
