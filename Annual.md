An annual plant completes its life cycle (from seed germination to flower production and seed formation) within one growing season. These plants typically germinate, grow, flower, set seed, and die within a single year. Common examples of annual plants include petunias, marigolds, and tomatoes. Annuals are often chosen for their vibrant flowers or productive fruiting and are useful for filling garden spaces with seasonal color.
