A bird house is a man-made structure designed to provide nesting sites and shelter for birds. These houses can be made from various materials and come in different shapes and sizes to attract specific bird species. Bird houses support local bird populations, promote biodiversity, and offer opportunities for birdwatching and nature appreciation.
