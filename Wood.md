Wood, derived from the trunks and branches of trees and shrubs, is a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems. It serves multiple ecological functions, such as providing habitat and food for various organisms, from insects to larger animals. Decomposing wood enriches the soil with organic matter and nutrients, promoting soil fertility and plant growth. In forests, wood helps stabilize the ecosystem by storing carbon, thus playing a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Additionally, wood is utilized by humans for building materials, fuel, and numerous other applications, emphasizing its importance across different spheres of life.
