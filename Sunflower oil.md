Sunflower oil is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus). It is widely used in cooking and food preparation due to its light flavor, high smoke point, and nutritional benefits. Rich in vitamin E and unsaturated fats, sunflower oil promotes heart health and provides antioxidants. It is also used in cosmetics and skincare products for its moisturizing and nourishing properties.
