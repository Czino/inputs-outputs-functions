A perching bird, or passerine, belongs to the order Passeriformes and is characterized by its ability to grasp and perch on branches and other surfaces. These birds have a unique toe arrangement that allows them to hold onto branches securely. Perching birds include species such as sparrows, finches, and robins, and they play significant roles in ecosystems as pollinators, seed dispersers, and insect controllers.
