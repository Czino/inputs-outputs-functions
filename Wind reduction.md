Wind reduction involves using natural or artificial barriers to decrease wind speed and protect plants, soil, and structures. Techniques include planting windbreaks or shelterbelts, which are rows of trees or shrubs designed to block and redirect wind. Wind reduction helps prevent soil erosion, reduce plant stress, and create more favorable microclimates for plant growth.
