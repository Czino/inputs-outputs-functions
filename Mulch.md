Mulch is a layer of organic or inorganic material spread over the soil surface in gardens and agricultural systems. In an ecological context, mulch serves multiple functions: it conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation, suppresses weed growth, regulates soil temperature, and adds organic matter and nutrients to the soil as it decomposes. Mulch also enhances soil structure, promotes healthy root systems, and provides a habitat for beneficial soil organisms. By mimicking the natural forest floor, mulch helps maintain a healthy, balanced ecosystem in cultivated environments.
