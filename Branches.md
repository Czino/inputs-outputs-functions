Branches are the limbs growing from the trunk or main stems of trees and shrubs. They support leaves, flowers, and fruits, facilitating photosynthesis and reproduction. Branches also provide structural stability and are essential for the overall growth and development of the plant. In addition to their ecological role, branches are often used in various crafts, construction, and as firewood.
