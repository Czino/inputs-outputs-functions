Hydraulic redistribution is the process of a plant translocating soil moisture to different soil depth as well as laterally through the root system.

After rainfall and at night, when the soil is satisfied with water on the surface level the tree will move it down the root system to be stored on deeper levels of the soil.

During the day, especially when the surface soil is dry, the stored moisture will be pulled back up to be transpired through the leaves.
