A house is a structure that serves as a dwelling for individuals and families, providing shelter, security, and a space for daily living activities. Houses vary widely in design, size, and materials, reflecting cultural, environmental, and personal preferences. In addition to offering protection from the elements, houses also serve as spaces for social interaction, relaxation, and personal expression.
