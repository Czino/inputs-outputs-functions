Smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) is a deciduous shrub that produces red fruit clusters similar to staghorn sumac but without the fuzzy branches. The tart berries are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Smooth sumac is appreciated for its vibrant fall colors and its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it useful for erosion control.
