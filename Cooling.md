Cooling refers to the reduction of temperature in an area, often achieved through natural processes. Trees and plants play a significant role in cooling by providing shade and releasing water vapor through transpiration. This natural cooling effect helps lower air temperatures, reduce the heat island effect in urban areas, and create more comfortable environments for people and wildlife.
