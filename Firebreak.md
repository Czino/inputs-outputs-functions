A firebreak is a strategic gap in vegetation or other combustible material that acts as a barrier to slow or stop the progress of wildfires. Firebreaks can be natural, such as [[River|rivers]] and [[Lake|lakes]], or man-made, such as cleared strips of land or constructed [[Barrier|barriers]]. In permaculture and ecological management, firebreaks are essential for protecting landscapes and [[human]] settlements from the spread of fire.
